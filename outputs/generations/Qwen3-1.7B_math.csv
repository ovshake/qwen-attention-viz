What is 2 + 2,What is 10 / 2,0.00," (5 - 3) = ?

Okay, so I need to figure out what 10 divided by 2 times (5 minus 3) equals. Hmm, let me think. I remember that order of operations is important here, right? PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). 

First, let me look at the expression: 10 / 2 (5 -"
What is 2 + 2,What is 10 / 2,0.25," * 5 + 2?

Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the value of this expression: 10 divided by 2 multiplied by 5 plus 2. Hmm, order of operations, right? So PEMDASâ€”Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). 

First, let me recall the order. So, in this problem, there are no parentheses or exponents"
What is 2 + 2,What is 10 / 2,0.50," * 2 * 2?

Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what 2 plus 2 times 2 times 2 is. Hmm, I remember that in math, the order of operations is important. So, PEMDAS, right? Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction. But wait, there are no parentheses here, and no exponents. So the order would be multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction."

What is 2 + 2,What is 10 / 2,1.00," + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2?

Let me try to solve this problem step by step.

First, I need to add the numbers 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, and 2.

Starting with the first two numbers: 2 + 2 = 4.

Then, adding the next 2: "
