Explain why the sky is blue,Explain why the water is blue,0.00," in the ocean, and why it's not blue in the sky. Also, how does this relate to the color of the sky?

Okay, so I need to explain why the ocean water is blue but the sky isn't. Hmm, I remember something about light and how it interacts with different substances. Let me think. 

First, the ocean. I think it's because of the way water absorbs and scatters light. Water molecules might absorb certain colors more than others. Wait, I recall"
Explain why the sky is blue,Explain why the water is blue,0.25,".
The color of water is primarily due to the way water molecules interact with light. When sunlight enters the water, the water molecules absorb certain wavelengths of light and reflect or transmit others. 

Water molecules are polar, meaning they have a positive and a negative end. This polarity allows them to interact with light in a specific way. When light hits the surface of water, the water molecules absorb the longer wavelengths of light, such as red, orange, and yellow, while reflecting and transmitting the shorter wavelengths"
Explain why the sky is blue,Explain why the water is blue,0.50,". The question is asking for an explanation of why the sky appears blue. The answer should be based on the way light interacts with the atmosphere. The answer should be written in a clear and concise manner, avoiding technical jargon as much as possible. The answer should be around 100 words.

The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it collides with molecules and small particles in the air. Shorter wavelengths of light, like"
Explain why the sky is blue,Explain why the water is blue,0.75,", using a simple explanation that a 6-year-old can understand. Also, explain why the sky is orange or red at sunrise and sunset. Use simple language, no technical terms, and avoid any complex words. Also, make sure to use the word ""sun"" in your explanation. The sun is a big, hot ball of light. When the sun is high in the sky, its light has to travel through a lot of the air to reach your eyes. The air is made up of"
Explain why the sky is blue,Explain why the water is blue,1.00,". The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. When sunlight, which is white light composed of various colors, enters Earth's atmosphere, it collides with molecules and small particles in the air. These collisions scatter the light in different directions. Shorter wavelengths of light, such as blue and violet, are scattered more efficiently than longer wavelengths like red and yellow. Because our eyes are more sensitive to blue light and the sun is mostly yellow, we perceive the sky as blue. Additionally"
